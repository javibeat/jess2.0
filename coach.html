                <p class="br">Change may seem uncomfortable and risky.
                    But how uncomfortable is it to stay in the same situation that is dragging you down emotionally and
                    mentally and not letting you progress in your career?</p>

                <p class="br">My name is Jessica Morari and I am a certified Life & Career Coach, specialized in Expats.
                    Since 2015 I have been mentoring and coaching international talents to build their best career
                    abroad
                    and thriving at it, as Hotel Manager first, and as a Certified Coach then.
                    My method will give you the key to gain clarity, improve your mindset and take action to finally get
                    what you deserve.</p>

                    <p class="br">My coaching method is based on three [not-so-secret] ingredients:</p>
                    <p>• CLARITY</p>
                    <p>• MINDSET</p>
                    <p class="br">• ACTION</p>
                    <p>Together we will assess your starting point: what you want to achieve through the process and
                        what is
                        currently standing in your way.</p>
                    <p>We will then thoroughly work on your mindset, your beliefs and your behaviors. The goal is to
                        substitute everything that is holding you back, with empowering tools that will push you toward
                        your
                        goal.</p>
                    <p>And finally we will take action. No use in planning and scheduling if you don't do anything with
                        it,
                        right?</p>
