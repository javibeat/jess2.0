                <p>Better relationships.</p>
                <p>Better job.</p>

                <p class="br">Helping people to develop their full potential, in life and career, is my obsession. We

                    feel fulfilled and passionate about what we do, and happy with our life, don't you think?</p>

                <p>As your coach, I’m here to provide guidance and support you to design the life and career of your
                    dreams.
                    But let me get this straight, I am not here to tell you what to do.</p>
                <p class="br">My commitment is to ask you thought-provoking, powerful [and sometimes uncomfortable]
                    questions to help
                    you go from surviving to thriving by building your best life abroad.</p>

                <p>My coaching method is based on simple ingredients: clarity, plan and action.</p>
                <p>Be ready to dive into yourself.</p>
                <p>Be ready to create a roadmap.</p>
