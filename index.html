                    <p class="testimonial">"I had the privilege of experiencing a session of high-value with Jessica.
                        She has created the possibility to learn invaluable insight in a timely manner without any
                        compromises. Firstly, Jessica started the session by taking the time to understand where I am at
                        in life and where I want to be. Her points were truly eye-opening; she provided practical
                        feedback on my CV and made me realize aspects I hadn't considered before. In addition to
                        pinpointing areas for improvement in my career strategy, she guided me to uncover my true self
                        and values. Her holistic approach doesn't just focus on professional development; it delves into
                        the core of who you are. I highly recommend Jessica to anyone seeking a career coach who seeks
                        to understand you and your experiences and is committed to guiding you not only in your
                        professional journey but also on a path of self-discovery and personal growth."</p>

                    <h3 class="br">Matea K.</h3>
                    <p class="testimonial">"I absolutely recommend Jessica as a coach, especially for those considering
                        a move abroad, whether for the first or sixth time. Her expertise is particularly beneficial for
                        young graduates seeking a seamless transition into the next chapter of their lives.
                        She is a very professional and friendly person. What I would highlight most about Jessica as a
                        Coach is her total neutrality during the sessions and the questions she asks always go deep to
                        get to the root of the problems or challenges. I have been lucky to experience several changes
                        after working together in both my personal and professional life. Given her homework after each
                        session, it felt great to be able to apply everything we covered in one session right away.
                        I would recommend Jessica to anyone looking for any kind of support in their day to day life,
                        both professionally and personally. Jessica is a great coach. Thank you for everything, Jessica,
                        from my heart and for making me see things that without you I would never have been able to see
                        or transform."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial">"Jessica always went the extra mile helping me to understand what I expected
                        from myself, to ask myself the right questions and to understand my reason for being. Thanks to
                        her I understood what I wanted and she helped me to focus on what I wanted to achieve, after a
                        few months / managed to enter in one of the most prestigious leagues in the world of luxury
                        hospitality, something I really wanted to achieve and without any doubt it would not have been
                        possible without meeting Jessica and sharing that valuable time with her.
                        I fully recommend Jessica to any professional, expat and dreamer who needs good and experienced
                        professional and personal advice."</p>
