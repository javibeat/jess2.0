                    <p>My name is Jessica Morari and I am a certified Life & Career Coach, specialized in Expats.
                        In a nutshell, I help those living outside their home country shape their experience abroad and
                        make the most of it, both personally and professionally.</p>

                <p>You might be wondering how I ended up here.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Originally from Milan, I moved to Spain in 2015 to pursue my career as a Hotel Manager.</p>
                <p>I found myself thousands of km aways from my family and lifelong friends, working 70+ hours per week
                    and
                    living a long-distance relationship.</p>
                <p>I felt that I was surviving instead of living my life as if I meant it.</p>
                <p>I knew I had to do something.</p>
                <p>Out of desperation, I attended a coaching session.</p>
                <p>I honestly didn't even really knew what coaching was back then. But from that moment everything
                    changed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After experiencing the power of coaching myself, I couldn't help but getting trained to bring the
                    same
                    change to other people around me. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Since then, I have been on the go around the world designing the life and the career that I have
                    always
                    dreamt about.</p>
                <p>And here I am to help you do the same: go from surviving to thriving, in life and work living abroad.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Wondering if we might be the perfect match to work on your life and/or career?</p>

                    <p>I take my work very seriously and that's why I always add a bit of humor to it.</p>
                    <p>It's my best ally when I want to take the heat off on a tough day or make a coachee relax during
                        a challenging session.</p>
