                <p>My name is Jessica and I am a Life & Career Coach specialized in highly achieving Expats.</p>
                <p>For more than 2 decades I have prided myself for being a Wonder Woman. I used to take on so much more
                    that I could possible bear, trying to not let anybody down while working [too] hard for the life and
                    career that I wanted to build.</p>
                <p>Until I cracked. System error. 404 mental health not found.
                    The first coaching session I attended marked the start of my [r]evolution.
                    Since then, I trained and certified to support other high achieving women around me to discover and
                    become who they really want to be and achieve what they deserve.</p>

                <p>It’s a path that we will walk together where you will get coaching workshops targeting the 6 most
                    common struggles for high achieving women.</p>

                <p>Each workshop is designed to make you think, plan and act.
