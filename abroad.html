        <p class="text">That's why I designed "Thriving Abroad", a 12-week journey based on 6 pillars that are the key

                <!-- Tarjeta 1 -->
                <div class="tarjeta">
                    <img src="assets/images/JessicaW.jpg" alt="Mozhan R">
                    <h3 class="br">Jessica W.</h3>
                    <p class="testimonial">"I had the pleasure of working with Jessica as an Expat Coach 
                        in the final semester of my bachelor’s degree.
                        In a period of uncertainty about post-university life, Jessica’s guidance was invaluable.
                        She skillfully helped me work through the challenges, ensuring I developed the competencies needed to feel confident about my next steps.
                        As a first-time coaching experience, Jessica really exceeded my expectations.
                        Despite my many years of experience as an expat,
                        her coaching helped me identify tools and strategies for a successful transition 
                        into post-graduate life abroad, including valuable career advice. Our coaching sessions were always tailored to exactly what I needed every time, and each session was impactful and gave me a gentle push to take actions that would help me towards my goals."</p>

                    <h3 class="br">Matea K.</h3>
                    <p class="testimonial">"I absolutely recommend Jessica as a coach, especially for those considering
                        a move abroad, whether for the first or sixth time. Her expertise is particularly beneficial for
                        young graduates seeking a seamless transition into the next chapter of their lives.
                        She is a very professional and friendly person. What I would highlight most about Jessica as a
                        Coach is her total neutrality during the sessions and the questions she asks always go deep to
                        get to the root of the problems or challenges. I have been lucky to experience several changes
                        after working together in both my personal and professional life. Given her homework after each
                        session, it felt great to be able to apply everything we covered in one session right away.
                        I would recommend Jessica to anyone looking for any kind of support in their day to day life,
                        both professionally and personally. Jessica is a great coach. Thank you for everything, Jessica,
                        from my heart and for making me see things that without you I would never have been able to see
                        or transform."</p>
